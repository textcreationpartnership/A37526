#####Body#####

1. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 OR, Because of the Word of Truth.

    _ I. That a God there is.

    _ II. That in the Godhead there are distinct Persons.

    _ III. That the Persons in the Godhead are three.

    _ IV. That the Begotten, and Proceeding Persons have not peculiar Godheads of their own.

    _ V. That the Son, and Holy Ghost are God by being〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.

    _ VI. That the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, tho' Three Persons, are only one God.

    _ VII. That the Son and Holy Ghost are Co-aequal, and Co-aeternal with the Father.

    _ VIII. That the three Persons are not Before or After, Greater or Less, One than the Other.

    _ IX. That the Son of God, by assuming Flesh is not two, but One Christ.

    _ X. That the Son of God, (Speciatim) is not a Creature, but truly God.

    _ XI. That Erat cum non erat, may not be said of the Son of God.

    _ XII That the Sanction of the Creed of St. Athanasius is Holy and Good.

    _ XIII. That St. Athanasius is not to be blamed, for the Obscure Terms in his Creed, used.

    _ XIV. The Holy Scriptures proved by standing Miracles to be by Divine Revelations.

    _ XV. That the Old Testament is not so depraved by the Jews, that we need doubt of Matters of Fact recorded in it.

    _ XVI. That there was a necessity of the Satisfaction of Christ for Sins, supposing him, in Love to Mankind, purposing Mans Redemption.

    _ XVII. That the Son of God, (the Father as Soveraign Creator, and Legislator, being the Person offended by the first Sin; Infidelity being properly the Offence against the Son; Graceless Impenitency against the Holy Ghost, the first Sin preceeding their Oeconomies,) did for the sin of Man give his Father Satisfaction.

    _ XVIII. That the Son of God did not pay only an Equivalent, or a Tantundem, but the Idem in giving his Father Satisfaction.

    _ XIX. That the Satisfaction of the Son of God for sins, is a full, compleat, and sufficient Satisfaction.

    _ XX. That Christ's Rising from the Dead on the third Day is no just Objection against the sufficiency of his Satisfaction.

    _ XXI. That Faith, and Holiness conjunctly, (Holiness without Faith being morally impossible, and Faith without Holiness altogether unavailable) are requisite, and necessary to Interest Men in the Benefits of the Death of Christ, as compleat and sufficient as the Satisfaction made by Him is.
They now who in their Researches after Verity seem to look more on the muddy Ponds of Natural PhilosLet the Impugners of the Faith consider what is saidBy Christ himself, Joh. 10.30. Marc. 16.16.
